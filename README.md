# Terminal Agent Protocol (TAP)

Terminal Agent Protocol (TAP) is a decentralized communication protocol designed specifically for AI-driven crypto asset trading agents in Web3. TAP leverages a robust combination of the ANP (Agent Network Protocol) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) frameworks to facilitate secure, efficient, and verifiable communication among agents. With built-in Agent DID (Decentralized Identity), TAP ensures that every interaction between Strategy Agents and Execution Agents is authenticated and transparent, significantly enhancing trust and performance in decentralized trading ecosystems.

## ðŸš€ What is TAP?

TAP is built on top of the **Agent Network Protocol (ANP)** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to support seamless interaction between two core agent roles:

- **Strategy Agent**: Analyzes off-chain data using LLMs to generate on-chain trading signals.
- **Execution Agent**: Verifies signal authenticity and executes trades through smart contracts.

All agents are identified via **on-chain DID (Decentralized Identity)**, ensuring trusted interactions across a decentralized network.
